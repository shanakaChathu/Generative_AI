Slow down and stop if necessary to avoid a collision. Always ensure the intersection is clear and safe before proceeding.\\n\\n3. **Pedestrian Crossings**: When turning left or right at any intersection, you must give way to any pedestrians crossing the road you are turning into. If there are pedestrian crossing signals or police officers, follow their instructions. If not, slow down while approaching and give way to pedestrians.\\n\\n4. **Traffic Control Signs**: Obey Stop and Give Way signs at intersections. Do not force your way in, prioritize safety over priority, and always give way when required.\\n\\n5. **Turning**: When making turns, plan early, confirm safety, and use indicators correctly. Give way to other vehicles and pedestrians on the road you are turning into.\\n\\n6. **Interchanges**: Interchanges can be complex, so plan ahead, check directional signs, signal your intentions early, and make appropriate adjustments while entering or exiting safely.\\n\\nRemember, safety is paramount at intersections, and it is crucial to follow the rules and be cautious to prevent accidents.'"
